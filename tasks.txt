1. In the first line of the program, define a variable called userName that is set to an empty string.
    If the user wants, he or she can enter his or her name in between the quotation marks.

2. Below this variable, create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user 
    enters a name or not. If the user enters a name — like 'Jane' — 
    use string interpolation to log Hello, Jane! to the console. Otherwise, simply log Hello!.

3. Create a variable named userQuestion. The value of the variable should be a string
     that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball.

4. Write a console.log() for the userQuestion, stating what was asked. 
    You can include the user’s name in the console.log() statement, if you wish!
